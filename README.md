## ðŸš€ About Me
My name is Silvin van Haestregt and I am a Software Developer in training.

I am 17 years old and started coding at the start of the pandamic in early 2020.

I noticed that I was really interested in this and so I continued and learned more and more.

I first started at a Minecraft server where I learned the language "Skript". This is a simplified version of Java which minecraft runs on. I enjoyed it so much that I went to school to become a Software Developer. And right know I am in my first year.


## ðŸ›  Skills
Python, HTML, CSS, C#, Java, Minecraft-Skript
